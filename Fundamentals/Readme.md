Distributed Systems - A colelection of independent computers that appears to its users as one Computer.
 - Computers operate Concurrently
 - Computers Fail Independently
 - They do not operate on Global Clock

 #### Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems
- Scalability (Horizontal, Vertical) - https://blog.algomaster.io/p/scalability
- Performance (Latency , Throughput)
- Availability
- Reliability (If System is reliable it is Available, but not vice versa)
- Other Key Characteristics
    - Security
    - Concurrency
    - Manageability

#### Types
- Client Server Architecture
- P2P Architecture

### Latency vs Throughput

- Latency determines the delay that a user experiences when they send or receive data from the network.
- Throughput determines the number of users that can access the network at the same time.

### Concurrency vs Parallelism

- Concurrent (Appears like parallel but not , ex : A chef Making a Salad  when  sandwich is in being heated)
    - Single Core Multi Threading
- Parallel (2 Chefs , 1 Making Sandwich , 1 Making Salad)
    - Multi Core Processing
